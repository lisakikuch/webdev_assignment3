< Japan Fun Fact Quiz >
The goal of this project is creating a web quiz so people can learn more about Japan while having fun.  

Description: 
1. To ensure that only designated users can access it, the user validation screen first prompts them to provide the specified password ('sushi'). The user must enter the proper information before the quiz appears. 

2. Once the validation is completed, the first question is displayed. It comes with a question, three options to answer, and a question counter on the top. 

3. When the user clicks on one option, an alert message pops up to let the user know if it is correct/incorrect. 

4. When the user clicks on the ‘ok’ button, the next question shows up, as the number on the question counter is added up. Repeat steps ‘3’ & ‘4’ until the user answers all the questions. 

5. At last, the score is displayed. 

 

Implementation process: 
1. Browsed websites that provided instructions on creating a JavaScript quiz (2023, Altcademy) and came up with a concept. 

2. Created the basic framework following the instructions, adding questions, options, and answers to the JS file. In the HTML file, created blank questions field to retrieve the questions from the JS file. 

3. Added functions required such as fake authentication, visual feedback to the user selection, question counter, and counting the score in JS, and made corresponding field in HTML at the same time. 

4. Used CSS to style and modify the webpage. Styled the input field and button using Bootstrap. 

Challenging: 
1. Creating the additional functions was difficult since I could not find the exact same examples. I had to modify the code to fit the needs or come up with the logic on my own. 

2. When new functions were added, the logic most of the time needed to be adjusted.  

3. The longer the code, the more difficult it was to locate the error. I took a long time to figure out how to fix the small typo that caused the issue. 

4. In addition, I had to ensure that JS code was not affected by styling in HTML and CSS.
